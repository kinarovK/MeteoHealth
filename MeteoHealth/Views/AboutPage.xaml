The application needs location data and internet access to perform the analysis. Knowing the location, it retrieves weather data on a daily basis which is referenced to the location set. For the analysis, you need to fill in a daily health score (where the higher the score, the more painful or worse you feel). If you have enough data, you can also run a query on the Report page. "
